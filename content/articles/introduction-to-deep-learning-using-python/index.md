This article will get you started in the field of Deep Learning. You will be directed through every single step of Deep learning. What you thought was hard will be the simplest thing you have ever tried to understand. This is your first step into the journey of Deep learning.   

### You will be able to know the following by the end of this article;

a) What is deep learning and why python for deep learning?
b) How deep learning works?
c) Application Areas of deep learning.
d) The need for deep learning today.

### What is Deep learning?

Deep learning is a part of Artificial intelligence. It  deals with neural networks to give an output. In our definition, the below questions arises. 
 These questions are;
    1. What is machine learning?
    2. What is artificial intelligence?
    3. What is an artificial neural network?

Machine Learning is a part of artificial intelligence. It
 deals with making machines to act intelligently through programs.
  For example, when playing a play station game. The machine that one is using uses algorithms to tell the next move, if you always play the same way each time you play. In this, we say that the computer has learned, but through its intelligence.

 Artificial intelligence is the ability of a machine to think intelligently.

   A. Netflix recommendations
   B. Siri

### Why python for deep learning.

  1.Python is a high-level language that uses an English-like language. This makes it easy for any new programmer to familiarize with the language.
 2. Every day Python gets new users. Thus the language has a high growth rate among individuals and companies.
 3. Python has a great library ecosystem. It contains a lot of tools that will enable you to perform  different functions in the language. For example, Keras used for deep learning.

### How deep learning works

We have already understood what deep learning is. We need now to take the next step of understanding how it works.

Deep learning uses many layers to extract a complete output. 
Imagine that you are a teacher in a middle age class. You then tell your class to write the numeric number 9. Every pupil will write this number in a different way. You as a teacher, you will be able to understand the number no matter how it looks. This is because your brain has been able to process and know different ways that the number 9 can appear. 

Deep learning acts also in this way. For the machine to be able to know a number, object, or alphabet no matter how it appears. Thus deep learning allows one to train or teach an AI machine. One teaches it to predict an output given a set of the same input represented in a different ways. This to be possible deep learning uses neural network layers.

     Types of layers in deep learning

 1. Input layer.
 2. Hidden layer.
 3. Output layer.

The input layer.- The machine takes in the same data represented in different ways. This includes all possible representations of a certain kind of data.

The hidden layer.- The computer performs a mathematical computation on the inputs. This is where deep learning occurs. Deep learning refers to having more than one hidden layer.

The output layer.- returns the results after it goes through the hidden layer.

The connection between neurons varies in weight. The weight dictates the importance of the input values. The neural network is a big and interesting topic. Do more research for better understanding. Below is a recommendation. [Neural Network and Deep Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Neural-Networks-Deep-Learning-Textbook-ebook/dp/B07FKF5HY7)  

Generally, that is how deep learning works. Read more on Convolution Neural networks and Recurrent Neural Networks.

### Application of deep learning

Having understood how deep learning works. It is better to know the application areas for deep learning.

1.Automate driving. - The car uses cameras and sensors to be able to identify obstacles on the roads. We input the same data of different representation into the system. This enables the system to be ready for any kind of representation of obstacles on the road.
2.  Aerospace and defense. - Deep learning helps to identify objects from the satellites. It locates areas of interest to the government.
3. It is also used in medical research to identify cancer cells. Deep learning combines data to show a better output when it identifies  cancer cells.
4.  Electronics. - Deep learning in electronics help sensors, speech recognition. Many companies are migrating to smart devices or electronics that need deep learning.

### The need for deep learning today

 In this generation technology has improved due to emerging trends in Artificial Intelligence. This has brought about a high increase in deep learning resources and development. This tells us that deep learning is very important to use and learn today. Deep learning helps us in:
                      1. Use of unstructured data.
                      2. Generating high output and accuracy in every situation.
                      3. Delivering high-quality and trustworthy results.
                      4. Helping companies and institutions to be able to cut on cost.

### software and tools to get you started with deep learning using Python.  

This is the beginning of using Python in deep learning. After the installation, you will be able to develop deep learning projects in Python.
Keras is the software that provide a python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras makes the implementation of deep learning in Python easier. It represents the interface of TensorFlow library.
So for you to use Keras it is also very important for you to install TensorFlow.
Depending on the IDE that you are using, Keras and TensorFlow can be gotten from the  IDE. This article will not be able to discuss the installation and how to work with these tools. This calls for more research on the reader's side.

### Conclusion

Deep learning is very interesting. With Python, you might have a few challenges before you get started. I hope that this article has made it easier for you to get started with deep learning. You will need to do more research on the subject until you get familiar with these tools. At the right time and with the right attitude and effort, you will be a pro in deep learning.
